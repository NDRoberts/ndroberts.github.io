								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>Once upon a time, I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in German (minor in philosopy!) 
								and stepped out into the wider world as a college graduate, ready to do... whatever it 
								was I thought I was going to do with that degree.  There is a chance I hadn't thought 
								it through very carefully.  The follies of youth, am I right?  Instead of that, I 
								spent the next eight years working in inpatient mental health.  It wasn't what I was 
								expecting, but it was an unprecedented opportunity to learn and grow.  Plus, great 
								stories to tell at parties.  Feel free to ask me.</p>
							<p>At some point, I found that I had reached the limits of my personal and professional 
								development on that path, and resolved to make some big changes.  I thought about 
								the things I could do that were not only interesting to me, but that were in slightly 
								greater demand than German.  The answer was pretty obvious when I realized that I 
								have consistenly had two great loves in my life - working with computers, and making 
								things difficult for myself.  Back to school I went.</p>
							<p>It took me three years and just about all of my life savings, but I successfully 
								completed a B.S. in Computer Science in December of 2020.  Now, I'm ready to bring 
								my unusual range of experience to the world of software development, along with a 
								growth mindset, an insatiable curiosity, and a well-developed sense of what's 
								important in life.  I'm genuinely excited by the idea that, through both my personal 
								and professional work, I have the chance to make the world a little better for 
								everyone.
